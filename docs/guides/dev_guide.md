# Developer Guide
One of the following should describe your use case.

## You want to do everything on your own
You need to host a server (we use Heroku for this), a database (we use Dropbox for this) and a machine which will run your spooler code (we use a cloud VM running Ubuntu for this). You do not need to do it exactly like us and can use different services.

## You want to use our infrastructure to connect your backend
This a bit more complicated because it involves sharing secrets like API keys. We have to discuss internally how we would do this.
