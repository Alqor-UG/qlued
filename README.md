This project handles user and device registration for quantum hardware simulators. It off-loads the need to implement this from the back-end developer and therefore brings specialized academic simulators closer to user. Its API is directly compatible with `qiskit-cold-atoms`. If you would just like to test it feel free to register on the running test case  provided by [Alqor](https://qlued.alqor.io). But we strongly would like to encourage others to set up their own instances and give it a try.
